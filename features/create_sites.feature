Feature: Create sites
  As a hacker who likes to blog
  I want to be able to make a static site
  In order to share my awesome ideas with the interwebs

  Scenario: Basic site
    Given I have an "index.html" file that contains "Basic Site"
    When I run jekyll
    Then the _site directory should exist
    And I should see "Basic Site" in "_site/index.html"

  Scenario: Basic site with a post
    Given I have a _posts directory
    And I have the following post:
      | title   | date      | content          |
      | Hackers | 3/27/2009 | My First Exploit |
    When I run jekyll
    Then the _site directory should exist
    And I should see "My First Exploit" in "_site/2009/03/27/hackers.html"

  Scenario: Basic site with layout and a page
    Given I have a _layouts directory
    And I have an "index.html" file with layout "default" that contains "Basic Site with Layout"
    And I have a default layout that contains "Page Layout: {{ content }}"
    When I run jekyll
    Then the _site directory should exist
    And I should see "Page Layout: Basic Site with Layout" in "_site/index.html"

  Scenario: Basic site with layout and a post
    Given I have a _layouts directory
    And I have a _posts directory
    And I have the following post:
      | title    | date      | layout  | content                         |
      | Wargames | 3/27/2009 | default | Would you like to play a game?" |
    And I have a default layout that contains "Post Layout: {{ content }}"
    When I run jekyll
    Then the _site directory should exist
    And I should see "Post Layout: Would you like to play a game?" in "_site/2009/03/27/wargames.html"

  Scenario: Basic site with include tag
    Given I have a _includes directory
    And I have an "index.html" file that contains "Basic Site with include tag: {% include about.html %}"
    And I have an "_includes/about.html" file that contains "Generated by Jekyll"
    When I run jekyll
    Then the _site directory should exist
    And I should see "Basic Site with include tag: Generated by Jekyll" in "_site/index.html"
