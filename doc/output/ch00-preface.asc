== Preface

Jekyll was born out the desire to create a blog engine that would make it
possible to write posts in my local text editor, version those posts with Git,
and keep up with my desire to tweak the styles and layout of my site.

In other words, I wanted something that fit into my existing software
development workflow and toolchain. Jekyll handles not only this case, but a
wide variety of other situations that call for static site generation based on
converted content and layout templates.

At its core, Jekyll is a text transformation engine. The concept behind the
system is this: you give it text written in your favorite markup language, be
that Markdown, Textile, or just plain HTML, and it churns that through a
layout or series of layout files. Throughout that process you can tweak how
you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed on the layout and
much more.

If you're looking for a simple, yet powerful solution to your blogging or
static site needs, Jekyll may be just what you've been looking for.
