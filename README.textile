h1. Jekyll

Blog like a developer.

h2. Example Proto-Site

My own personal site/blog is generated with Jekyll.

The proto-site repo ("http://github.com/mojombo/tpw":http://github.com/mojombo/tpw)
is converted into the actual site ("http://tom.preston-werner.com/":http://tom.preston-werner.com)

and run the software from there.

  $ git clone git://github.com/mojombo/jekyll
  $ cd jekyll
