<!--
  Hi! Thanks for considering to file a bug with Jekyll.  Please take the
  the basic questions (convert `[ ]` into `[x]` to check it (or submit and check.)
  If are no need for certain fields like output and redirection, please delete
  those headers before submitting.  We know not all tickets require those
  steps.  Otherwise, please try to be as detailed as possible.
  
  If you are unsure this is a bug in Jekyll, or this is a bug caused
  by a plugin that isn't directly related to Jekyll, or if this is just
  a generic usage question, please consider asking your question at
  https://talk.jekyllrb.com where non-bug questions go.
  
  Thanks!

- [ ] I believe this to be a bug, not a question about using Jekyll.
- [ ] I Read the CONTRIBUTION file at https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.markdown
- [ ] I Updated to the latest Jekyll (or) if on Github Pages to the latest `github-pages`

  If you are on a minor sub-distro (such as ElementaryOS which does not diverge from
  Ubuntu much, please check the parent distro. Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Lubuntu should

- [ ] I was trying to install.
- [ ] There is a broken Plugin API.
- [ ] I was trying to build.
- [ ] It was another bug.

## My Reproduction Steps

<!--
  Insert the steps you took to for this problem to exist.  Such as the
  directories you created and, the full command you ran, and include any
  plugins you have installed, this is very important.
  
  If your steps are complicated, you can also submit a Github
  repository (please no zips, they will be removed and rejected by maintainers,)
  and just supply a command for us to reproduce it ourselves.
-->

## The Output I Got

<!-- 
  Insert the output from the command.  Alter it as little as you can.
  The minimum should be personal information.  Though we normally don't log
  anything like that so there shoul be no need to alter it.
