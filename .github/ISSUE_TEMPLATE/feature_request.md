<!--
  Hi! Thanks for considering to file a feature request with Jekyll. Please take the time to
  answer the basic questions. Please try to be as detailed as possible.

  Thanks!
-->

## Summary

<!--
  A one-paragraph explanation of the feature.
-->

## Motivation

<!--
  Why do you want to see this feature in Jekyll? What makes you sure that it should not be
  implemented at the plugin level, but in Jekyll core? What use cases does it support?

  NOTE: Please be mindful of the Jekyll philosophy (https://jekyllrb.com/philosophy/),
  particularily Section 5. Think about if 90% of the users would benefit from your
  feature request, and whether your feature would be better off in a plugin.
-->

## Guide-level explanation

<!--
  Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the project and you
  were teaching it to another programmer. That generally means:

  - Introducing new named concepts.
  - Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
  - If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or
    migration guidance.

  If this is a small feature, you may omit this section.
-->

## Reference-level explanation

<!--
  This is the technical portion of the feature request. Explain the design in
  sufficient detail that:

  - Its interaction with other features is clear.
  - It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
  - Corner cases are dissected by example.

  If you do not know how to answer this, you can omit it. No worries!
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
  Why should we *not* do this?
-->

## Unresolved Questions

<!--
  What related issues do you consider out of scope for this feature that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  feature?
