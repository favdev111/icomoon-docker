<!--
  Hi! Thanks for considering to file a bug with Jekyll. Please take the time to
  answer the basic questions. Please try to be as detailed as possible.

  If you are unsure this is a bug in Jekyll, or this is a bug caused
  by a plugin that isn't directly related to Jekyll, or if this is just
  a generic usage question, please consider asking your question at
  https://talk.jekyllrb.com where non-bug questions go.

  Thanks!
-->

<!-- 
  Make sure that you've done all of these. If you're sure that the bug you're
  reporting is only apparent in a previous version of Jekyll, please say so explicitly
  in your description.

  - I updated to the latest Jekyll (or) if on GitHub Pages to the latest `github-pages`
  - I ran `jekyll doctor` to check my configuration
  - I read the contributing document at https://jekyllrb.com/docs/contributing/
-->

## My Environment

<!--
  Replace the values in the Version(s) column with the ones in your build. If you're not
  using `github-pages`, just replace it with "No".
-->

| Software         | Version(s) |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Operating System |            |
| `jekyll`         | Latest     |
| `github-pages`   | Latest     |

## Current Behavior

<!--

  problem to exist, such as the directories you created and the full command
  you ran. Include any plugins you have installed (this is very important!).

  You can include any logs you think relevant here. If you're using GitHub pages
  and you're not sure where your logs are, please email support@github.com and
  they will happily help you.
