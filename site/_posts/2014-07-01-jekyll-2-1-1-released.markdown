This is a security release for Jekyll 2.1.0. It covers two vulnerabilities:

1. One in the reading of data
2. One in the `layouts` setting

They were identified in Jekyll 1.5.1 and has been confirmed as patched
in this version and the version used by GitHub Pages. If you are in the
business of building Jekyll sites, please ensure you upgrade to 2.1.1 as
soon as possible.
