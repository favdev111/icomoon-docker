1. [Collections](/docs/collections/)
2. Brand new site template for `jekyll new` (thanks [@jglovier][]!)
3. [Native Sass & CoffeeScript support](/docs/assets/)
4. [YAML Front-Matter defaults](/docs/configuration/#frontmatter_defaults)
5. Custom markdown processors
6. Addition of `where` and `group_by` Liquid filters
7. Switch from Maruku to Kramdown as default markdown converter

Check out our [changelog][] for a complete list of all (200+) changes.

Happy developing!
