Not everything is a post or a page. Maybe you want to document the various methods in your open source project, members of a team, or talks at a conference. Collections allow you to define a new type of document that behave like Pages or Posts do normally, but also have their own unique properties and namespace.

## Using Collections

### Step 1: Tell Jekyll to read in your collection

Add the following to your site's `_config.yml` file, replacing `my_collection` with the name of your collection:

{% highlight yaml %}
collections:
- my_collection
{% endhighlight %}

### Step 2: Add your content

Create a corresponding folder (e.g. `<source>/_my_collection`) and add documents.
YAML front-matter is read in as data if it exists, if not, then everything is just stuck in the Document's `content` attribute.

Note: the folder must be named identical to the collection you defined in you config.yml file, with the addition of the preceding `_` character.

### Step 3: Optionally render your collection's documents into independent files

If you'd like Jekyll to create a public-facing, rendered version of each document in your collection, add your collection name to the `render` config key in your `_config.yml`:

{% highlight yaml %}
render:
- my_collection
{% endhighlight %}

This will produce a file for each document in the collection.
For example, if you have `_my_collection/some_subdir/some_doc.md`,
it will be rendered using Liquid and the Markdown converter of your
choice and written out to `<dest>/my_collection/some_subdir/some_doc.html`.

## Liquid Attributes

### Collections

Each collection is accessible via the `site` Liquid variable. For example, if you want to access the `albums` collection found in `_albums`, you'd use `site.albums`. Each collection is itself an array of documents (e.g. `site.albums` is an array of documents, much like `site.pages` and `site.posts`). See below for how to access attributes of those documents.

### Documents

In addition to any YAML front-matter provided in the document's corresponding file, each document has the following attributes:

<div class="mobile-side-scroller">
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Variable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>content</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          The content of the document. If no YAML front-matter is provided,
          this is the entirety of the file contents. If YAML front-matter
          is used, then this is all the contents of the file after the terminating
          `---` of the front-matter.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>path</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          The full path to the document's source file.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>relative_path</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          The path to the document's source file relative to the site source.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>url</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          The URL of the rendered collection. The file is only written to the
          destination when the name of the collection to which it belongs is
          included in the <code>render</code> key in the site's configuration file.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>
