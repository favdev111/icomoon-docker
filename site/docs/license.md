You may use any Jekyll project under the terms of the [MIT License]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/LICENSE). The MIT License is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with a Jekyll project. You are free to use any Jekyll project in any other project (even commercial projects) as long as the copyright header is left intact.
