[BuddyWorks][0] is a [Docker][1]-based CI server that you can set up in 15-20 minutes to build, test, and deploy your Jekyll websites. It supports [GitHub][2], [Bitbucket][3], and [GitLab][4] repositories, can be installed on-premises or in cloud. The following guide will show you how to set up a free environment to build and test your Jekyll project.

## 1. Getting started

1. Log in at <https://buddy.works> with your GitHub/Bitbucket account or email
2. Choose your Git provider and select or push your Jekyll Project
3. Create a new pipeline and set the trigger mode to 'On every push'
4. Add the Jekyll action and save the pipeline

## 2. How it works

Whenever you make a push to the selected branch, the Jekyll action runs `jekyll build` in an isolated [Jekyll Docker image][0]. The output is generated to the `/filesystem` directory, and can be further deployed to FTP/SFTP and Cloud services. You can add your own commands, install additional packages, attach services, and run Selenium tests, as well as add other actions down the pipeline, eg. a Slack notification or an SSH script that will restart your server.

## 3. Using YAML for configuration

If you prefer configuration as code over GUI, you can generate `buddy.yml` that will create a pipeline with the Jekyll action once pushed to the repository:

```ruby
- pipeline: "Build and Deploy Jekyll site"
  trigger_mode: "ON_EVERY_PUSH"
  ref_name: "master"
  actions:
  - action: "Execute: jekyll build"
    type: "BUILD"
    docker_image_name: "jekyll/jekyll"
    docker_image_tag: "latest"
    execute_commands:
    - "# Working directory with cloned repository: /srv/jekyll"
    - "jekyll build"
```

## 4. Setting up on-premises server

The self-hosted version of BuddyWorks can be installed on any type of server supporting Docker, including [Linux][1], [Mac][2], [AWS EC2][3], [DigitalOcean][4], and [Microsoft Azure][5].
