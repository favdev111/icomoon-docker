## Getting Help

**Jekyll's issue tracker is not a support forum.**

If you're looking for support for Jekyll, there are a lot of options:

* Read [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
* If you have a question about using Jekyll, start a discussion on [Jekyll Forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll)
* Chat with Jekyllers &mdash; Join [our Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/jekyll/jekyll) or [our IRC channel on Freenode](irc:irc.freenode.net/jekyll)

There are a bunch of helpful community members on these services that should be willing to point you in the right direction.
