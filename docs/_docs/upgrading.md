Upgrading from an older version of Jekyll? Upgrading to a new major version of
Jekyll (e.g. from v2.x to v3.x) may cause some headaches. Take the following
guides to aid your upgrade:

- [From 0.x to 1.x and 2.x](/docs/upgrading/0-to-2/)
- [From 2.x to 3.x](/docs/upgrading/2-to-3/)
- [From 3.x to 4.x](/docs/upgrading/3-to-4/)

## Minor updates

<div class="note">
  <h5>Stay Up to Date</h5>
  <p>We recommend you update Jekyll as often as possible to benefit from
  the latest bug fixes.
  </p>

If you followed our setup recommendations and installed [Bundler](http://bundler.io/), run `bundle update jekyll` or simply `bundle update` and all your gems will
update to the latest versions.

If you don't have Bundler installed, run `gem update jekyll`.

The procedure is similar [if you use the `github-pages`
gem](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#keeping-your-site-up-to-date-with-the-github-pages-gem).
