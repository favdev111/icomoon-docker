Installation on other Linux distributions works similarly as on [Ubuntu](../ubuntu/).

On Fedora, the dependencies can be installed as follows:

 ```sh
sudo dnf install ruby ruby-devel @development-tools
```

On Debian:

```sh
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential
```

The rest works the same as on [Ubuntu](../ubuntu/).
