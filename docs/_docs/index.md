This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Jekyll. We’ll cover topics such as getting your site up and running, creating and managing content, customizing your build, and deploying.

## What is Jekyll, exactly?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.

You create your content as text files ([Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)), and organize them into folders. Then, you build the shell of your site using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)-enhanced HTML templates. Jekyll automatically stitches the content and templates together, generating a website made entirely of static assets, suitable for uploading to any server.

Jekyll happens to be the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), so you can host your project’s Jekyll page/blog/website on GitHub’s servers **for free**.
