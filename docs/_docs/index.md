Jekyll is a static site generator. You give it text written in your
favorite markup language and it uses layouts to create a static website. You can
tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed on the
site, and more.

## Prerequisites

See [requirements](/docs/installation/#requirements).

## Instructions

1. Install a full [Ruby development environment](/docs/installation/).
2. Install Jekyll and [bundler](/docs/ruby-101/#bundler) [gems](/docs/ruby-101/#gems).
```
gem install jekyll bundler
```
3. Create a new Jekyll site at `./myblog`.
```
jekyll new myblog
```
4. Change into your new directory.
```
cd myblog
```
5. Build the site and make it available on a local server.
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
6. Browse to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000){:target="_blank"}

If you encounter any errors during this process, see the
[troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/#configuration-problems) page. Also,
make sure you've installed the development headers and other prerequisites as
mentioned on the [requirements](/docs/installation/#requirements) page.
