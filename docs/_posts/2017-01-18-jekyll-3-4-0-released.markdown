Hey there! We have a quick update of Jekyll for you to enjoy this January.
Packed full of bug fixes as usual, thanks to the tireless efforts of our
exceptional Jekyll community. Three changes to call out:

1. If you're a big fan of [`where_by_exp`](/docs/filters/), you'll be an
even bigger fan of [`group_by_exp`](/docs/filters/).
2. Using a custom timezone in Jekyll on Windows? Yeah, sorry that hasn't ever worked
   properly. We made it possible to accurately [set the timezone using IANA
   timezone codes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/#timezone-management).
3.

And [lots and lots more!](/docs/history/#v3-4-0)

This update was made possible by the dedicated efforts of our excellent
contributors: CONTRIB LIST HERE.

As always, if you encounter bugs, please do [search the issues]({{ site.repository }}/issues)
and [file an issue]({{ site.repository }}/issues/new) if you aren't able to
find a resolution. We also have [our Jekyll Talk
forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com) for those of you with general questions
about how to accomplish certain tasks with Jekyll.

We have some exciting updates in store for v3.5, and we're hard at work on
those already.

Happy Jekylling!
