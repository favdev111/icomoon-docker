Hey there! We have a quick updated of Jekyll for you to enjoy this January.
Packed full of bug fixes as usual, thanks to the tireless efforts of our
exceptional Jekyll community. Three changes to call out:

1. If you're a big fan of [`where_by_exp`](/docs/filters/), you'll be an
even bigger fan of [`group_by_exp`](/docs/filters/).
2. Using a custom timezone in Jekyll on Windows? Yeah, sorry that hasn't ever worked
   properly. We made the internals possible
