We have another patch release in the 3.8 series! This time, we have one security patch
and a handful of bug patches, including:

- Filter symlinks from theme gems
- Fix excerpt handling of some Liquid tags
- Handle case where a theme directory doesn't exist
- A few internal optimizations to reduce memory overhead

... and a few more! You can check out the patches and see all the details in [the release notes](/docs/history/#v3-8-6)

Happy Jekylling!
