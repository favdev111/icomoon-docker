We're super excited to announce the launch of [Jekyll Talk](https://talk.jekyllrb.com), a Discourse forum for anything related to Jekyll!

The forum was set up by [@envygeeks](https://github.com/envygeeks) to build a community more accessible to Jekyll users and more suitable for general discussion.

There's already been a lot of interesting topics, including a site showcase and a poll for Jekyll 3.0 priorities.

Come join the fun!
