Dear Jekyllers,

It's time for another pre-release of Jekyll 4! ðŸŽ‰

This pre-release moves us further down the path of releasing Jekyll 4.0.0. All the same goodies [from the last pre-release](/news/2019/03/18/jekyll-4-0-0-pre-alpha1-released/) are here, along with a few more things I want to highlight:

Jekyll 4.0 is a new *major* version and it comes with a few breaking changes, notably :

1. We dropped support for [Ruby 2.3 which EOL at the end of March 2019](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).
   GitHub Pages runs Ruby 2.5.x, services like Netlify or Forestry already upgraded to latest Ruby 2.6.x.
2. `link` tag now include `relative_url` filter, hurray [no more need to prepend `{% raw %}{{ site.baseurl }}{% endraw %}` ](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/6727).
3. [`{% raw %}{% highlight %}{% endraw %}` now behaves like `{% raw %}{% raw %}{% endraw %}`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/6821), so you can no longer use `include` tags within.
4. We dropped support for Pygments, RedCarpet and rdiscount.
5. We bumped kramdown to v2.

If you're a plugin developer, we still need your feedback! Your plugin may not work with version 4 and we'd like to fix those issues before we release.

Checkout the complete [changelog](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/releases/tag/v4.0.0.pre.beta1) for more details.

To test this pre version run:

```sh
gem install jekyll --pre
```

Please test this version thoroughly and file bugs as you encounter them.
