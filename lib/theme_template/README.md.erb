# <%= theme_name %>

Welcome to your new Jekyll theme! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your theme into a gem. Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes` and your sass in `_sass`. To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem <%= theme_name.inspect %>
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
theme: <%= theme_name %>
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install <%= theme_name %>

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here. Describe your available layouts, includes, and/or sass.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

To test your theme, run `bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme and the contents of the `example/` directory. As you make modifications to your theme and to the example site, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.
